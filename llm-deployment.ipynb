    "prompt = \"the need for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in patients with an implanted pacemaker or implantable cardioverter - defibrillator ( icd ) is a growing clinical issue . it is estimated that as many as 75% of active cardiac device recipients will become indicated for mri . currently , the vast majority of such devices are contraindicated for use with an mri . in european heart rhythm association survey , published recently for non - mri - certified icds ( 0.51.5 t field strength ) , the totally subcutaneous icd ( s - icd ) system , an implantable defibrillator with no leads that touch the heart , has recently been demonstrated to be a safe and effective defibrillator option for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death . it provides shock therapy and post - shock pacing therapy , but no long - term bradycardia pacing . although it has been shown as an alternative to the standard transvenous icd , its compatibility with mri remains unclear . various types of clinical mri systems currently use a superconductive magnet that creates a static magnetic field strength , typically 1.5 or 3 t. the use of mri with most pacemakers and icds is considered a contraindication due to potential hazards , including heating of the electrode that resides in or on the heart , damage to myocardium , elevation of pacing thresholds , unintended induction of ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) or ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) , pacing inhibition , permanent device malfunction , and distortion of the mri scan . recently , mr - conditional. mr - conditional indicates a lack of known hazards in a specified mri environment with specified conditions of use . due to the variety of mri scanners and scanning protocols , it is not practical to test even a single device under all conditions . hence , mr - conditional labelling dictates that the device is safe for use under certain scanning conditions , as well as how the cardiac device should be programmed before an exposure to the magnetic field in a mri scanner . the literature , although limited , provides some guidance for imaging patients with implanted pacemakers or icds that do not have mr - conditional labelling . this single - centre prospective non - controlled study describes the first use of mri in patients with an implanted s - icd . patients with implanted s - icd systems ( boston scientific sqrx model 1010 and q - trak model 3010 ) were enrolled for mri testing over a period of 18 months . the s - icd system implanted in this patient cohort was composed of a can implanted in a left mid - lateral pocket and a para - sternal subcutaneous electrode . the s - icd is currently not certified for use with an mri ; therefore , the ethics committee of homolka hospital , prague , czech republic approved our clinical study . patients with newly implanted s - icd systems ( < 6 weeks ) were excluded , and none of the patients had any intravascular leads . the patients were randomized for either a cardiac , brain , cervical , or lumbar spinal scan . one of the subjects underwent an additional knee examination , due to reported chronic pain . a total of 15 patients were enrolled into this study ( 12 males and three females , aged 2283 years , mean 53 years . subjects in our cohort ( table 1 ) underwent a total of 22 mri scans between 6 june 2012 and 24 december 2013 . in total , five brain scans , three cardiac scans , 12 lumbar scans , one knee , and one cervical spine scan were conducted ( table 2 ) . however , in one patient a minor disc protrusion was found , in other mri revealed stenosis of intervertebral foramen which was causing radicular pain of the nerve root l4 and based on this examination the patient was referred to ct -

icd system are on or in the heart , heating near or around however , heating near the electrode or can with the s - icd system may still cause serious patient discomfort . therefore , along with education of subjects , each patient was instrumented by taping an oesophageal temperature probe ( beta -

icd system are on or in the heart , heating near or around the electrode can not harm the myocardium . however , heating near the electrode or can with the s - icd system may still cause serious patient discomfort . therefore , along with education of subjects , each patient was instrumented by taping an oesophageal temperature probe ( beta - therm model g22k7mcd8 ) on the skin over the mid - lateral implant site to record any temperature excursions that might be correlated to patient symptoms of heating / discomfort near the pocket . to minimize the risk of inappropriate therapy , the s - icd system was programmed to therapy each s - icd system was evaluated prior to and immediately after the scan to verify proper functioning , including interrogation , sensing , and battery voltage . after the completion of the mri , the s - icd system was reprogrammed to original settings . long - term regular clinical follow - up and checking of the device were performed . no anomalies were noted via pulse oximetry or ecg during the scans for any of the patients . eleven of 15 patients reported no sensation or pain from heating of the can , two of 15 patients reported feeling some heating , and two patients reported intolerable heating ( see table 2 ) . in patients with intolerable heating , the scan was halted within seconds and changed to a scan of the brain , which proceeded without incident . patient reports of heating in the vicinity of the can occurred only during lumbar scans with a thermistor probe ; no such reports occurred during scans of the brain , cardiac area , cervical spine , or without the probe . in two cases where heating in the vicinity of the can was reported by the patient , the scan sequence was altered to reduce the intensity of radiofrequency ( rf ) field exposure by reducing the turbo factor ( e.g. from 21 to 7 ) , increasing the repetition time ( e.g. to > 4000 ms ) , and reducing the flip angle ( e.g. from 170 to 120 ) . the target values were chosen arbitrarily to maintain image contrast ( flip angle ) and keep scan time at reasonable limits ( turbo factor and repetition time ) . less heating was noted by patients after these modifications to the scan parameters were made . 03 ) was observed to have a skin lesion , appearing to be a circular rash or ulcer on the surface of the skin over the can , approximately 35 mm in diameter . the cause of this skin anomaly is not known ; it was later noted to have fully healed at a follow - up 10 days after the scan . to ascertain the effect of heating due to the instrumented thermistor catheter , the two patients who experienced the heating ( examinations 9 and 16 , see table 2 ) were rescanned several weeks later without the thermistor catheter in place ( examinations 11 and 17 ) . first , modified sequence ( with even lower amount of energy deposited in the tissue ) was used , which caused no heating . as no sensation was reported by the subjects , they were asked to report even a minimal discomfort , and the lumbar scans were performed using the same settings that resulted in heating with the thermistor catheter in place in the first imaging session . the results of the rescans revealed that no heating was felt by the patients when the thermistor catheter was absent . there were no noted changes to battery voltage , ability to detect the qrs signal or stored diagnostic data . pacing thresholds can not be assessed by the s - icd system , so this was not evaluated . none of the patients reported any pulling or twisting of the can or pain from heating of the s - icd electrode . for scans of the brain , lumbar spine , knee , and cervical spine , no effect from image artefact was noted in the anatomical area of interest . however , for scans of the cardiac area , image artefact was noted to interfere with the ability to see parts of the left ventricle , though the right ventricle of the heart was unaffected and could be imaged usefully . this was due to the can and not the electrode ( see figure 1 ) , modifications to the protocol for the lumbar spine resulted in a lower signal -

conditional pacemakers from several companies , but very limited reports about mr - conditional icds . biotronik announced in late 2011 release of their first mr - compatible icd device and defibrillator leads pro mri , but in the conditions of use excluded scanning of the torso and focused more on the extremities examination . in european heart rhythm association survey , 60% of centres did not implant any mri - certified icds , 34.3% implanted < 10 icd devices , and only 5.6% implanted 10 and more icds ; one - fifth of responders stated that mri - certified icds should be implanted in all patients but lack of reimbursement was indicated as a possible obstacle to implant more mri - certified pacemakers / icds by 47.1% of responding centres . none of the components of the s - icd system are on or in the heart . the s - icd depends less upon being in direct contact with the myocardium to function and instead uses far - field sensing and stimulation to provide the shock and post - shock pacing therapy . as a consequence , unlike transvenous systems heating near or around the electrode can not harm the myocardium , which could present with possible safety consequences such as an elevation in pacing thresholds or scarring of the myocardium , but it may still cause serious patient discomfort . because the s - icd is larger than modern transvenous icd 's , there may be more potential for the can to experience heating due to the magnetic gradient or rf field . we report results from what we believe is the first experience of mri scanning in patients with an implanted s - icd and in various anatomical areas . overall , mri was performed safely in all patients , which is in contrast to the current literature with mri imaging in patients with electrical - active devices which are not mri - conditional . in our study , the primary clinically significant event attributable to the mri scan was the occurrence of heating in the area of the pocket in the four patients that underwent lumbar scans . it was not known if this was due to the s - icd can itself or an artefact of the thermistor catheter used to measure skin temperature over the pocket . this required a revision of our protocol , which was to re - scan two of the patients who complained of heating . re - scanning of these patients without the thermistor probe resulted in no complaints of heating , so it is assumed that the thermistor catheter itself heated during the lumbar scans and caused the discomfort . as further evidence , all the heating complaints occurred during rf - intensive scan sequences ( namely fast spin echo ) with the temperature probe located axially near the centre of the bore , where rf fields are the highest . the thermistor catheter is constructed of insulated conductive cables connected to electrodes and should couple to the rf fields efficiently , causing heating at the electrodes and pain or damage on the surface of the skin where the probe was placed over the s - icd can . if the heating was due to the s - icd can itself , it would more likely occur during gradient - intensive scan sequences ( which can generate eddy currents on can surfaces and internal components ) and at locations in the bore where there are high gradient fields , such as near the bore edges . however , when the patient was scanned with gradient - intensive scan sequences ( e.g. flair dwi ) and with the s - icd system in high gradient field locations in the bore ( e.g. such as during a brain scan ) , patients did not detect any heating or discomfort . in addition , the subcutaneous lead , which was not instrumented with a thermistor catheter , never resulted in any heating sensation noted by the patient , even when exactly the same sequence that resulted in heating in the first session was used . the use of mri - compatible temperature monitors such as fibre optic temperature probes would have provided better confirmation of possible skin temperature elevation and would not have been affected by the rf fields . for cardiac imaging , the main problem to solve is metallic artefact , especially on the gradient - echo sequences . like in research performed by nazarian et al . , several scan protocols were used to see if any yielded different effects or reduced the qualitative extent of artefact . gradient mode was changed from normal to whisper , resulting in slower ramping of the field and therefore diminishing the changes of the magnetic field in time . artefacts when present were limited to blurring of the left ventricle during cardiac scans and most yielded clinically useful information . standard interrogation of the s - icd revealed no adverse effects upon the functioning of the system . while no adverse effects upon the post - scan s - icd device function were noted , not all possible scanning protocols were tested . it should be noted that , four of the s - icd 's were exposed to repeat mri scans without adverse effects to device function . in addition , because the s - icd does not provide long - term bradycardia pacing , it is assumed that pacemaker - dependent patients would not be implanted with this system . the inhibition of the pacemaker function during the scanning sequence and possible pacing threshold changes are a unique concern in patients implanted with transvenous icds . this study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 t mri scanner . thus , even these preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 t mri scanners ( similarly as reported in the present literature for other implantable devices ) . device functionality was tested immediately after the scan but not for long - term effects . in addition , not all device functions were tested although the s - icd system does have a beeper / interrogation warning if battery levels or memory irregularities occur . however , patients were scheduled for regular check - up and no defect of the device was observed in following 725 months ( mean observation time 18 months ) . delayed enhancement mri for determining cardiac scarring was also not tested . also , there are other anatomical areas that were not evaluated , such as shoulder and knees . this study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 t mri scanner . thus , even these preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 t mri scanners ( similarly as reported in the present literature for other implantable devices ) . device functionality was tested immediately after the scan but not for long -

conditional , this study is the study to demonstrate the feasibility of exposing s - icd patients to mri using the scanning and monitor protocol described , with some precautionary measures including : ( i ) programming the device therapy off ; ( ii ) limiting the sar to 2.0 w / kg ; ( iii ) continuous monitoring of the patients pulse oximetry and ecg by qualified personnel and especially for any feelings of heating ; ( iv ) evaluate device function post scan ; ( v ) availability of full resuscitation facilities at the mri site . given the variables of different mri scanners , the decision to perform mri on patients with an implanted s - icd system should be balanced against the potential risks . in our study , the only heating was very likely introduced by not fully mri - compatible thermometer probe ; subjects rescanned without the probe did not report any abnormalities during the scan of any body area listed ( brain , cervical and lumbar spine , heart , and knee ) . this study was supported by iga mz r nt12094/2011 , research project charles university in prague , prvouk p34 and unce 204010/2012 . funding to pay the open access publication charges for this article was provided by iga mz r nt12094/2011 .\"\n",
